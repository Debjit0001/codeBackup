        <h1>Ford Mustang</h1>
    <p>The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964,
        the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation, it is the
        fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was
        developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially
        distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.</p>

    <h3 id="name">Name</h3>
    <p>
        Executive stylist John Najjar, who was a fan of the World War II P-51 Mustang fighter plane, is credited by Ford
        with suggesting the name.[10][11] Najjar co-designed the first prototype of the Ford Mustang known as the "Ford
        Mustang I" in 1961, working jointly with fellow Ford stylist Philip T. Clark.[12] The Mustang I made its formal
        debut at the United States Grand Prix in Watkins Glen, New York, on October 7, 1962, where test driver and
        contemporary Formula One race driver Dan Gurney lapped the track in a demonstration using the second "race"
        prototype. <br/>

        An alternative view was that Robert J. Eggert, Ford Division market research manager, first suggested the
        Mustang name. Eggert, a breeder of quarterhorses, received a birthday present from his wife of the book, The
        Mustangs by J. Frank Dobie in 1960. Later, the book's title gave him the idea of adding the "Mustang" name for
        Ford's new concept car. The designer preferred Cougar (early styling bucks can be seen wearing a Cougar grille
        emblem) or Torino (an advertising campaign using the Torino name was actually prepared), while Henry Ford II
        wanted T-bird II.[14] As the person responsible for Ford's research on potential names, Eggert added "Mustang"
        to the list to be tested by focus groups; "Mustang", by a wide margin, came out on top under the heading:
        "Suitability as Name for the Special Car".[15][16] The name could not be used in Germany,[14] however, because
        it was owned by Krupp, which had manufactured trucks between 1951 and 1964 with the name "Mustang". Ford refused
        to buy the name for about US$10,000 (equivalent to $87,371 in 2021)[17] from Krupp at the time. Kreidler, a
        manufacturer of mopeds, also used the name, so Mustangs were sold in Germany as "T-5s" until December 1978.

    <p>Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project—supervising the overall development of the car in a record 18 months[19]—while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager.[20] The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine roadster. This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.

        The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 in (69 mm) lower.[21] It was originally based on the platform of the second-generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car.[22] Gale Halderman's side view design is the basis for the first clay model.[23][24]
        
        Non-traditional (1964½) introduction
        
        1965 "fastback", introduced in September 1964 for the 1965 model year
        The Ford Mustang began production five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are often referred to as "1964½ models" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates in August 1964 at the formal start of the 1965 production year contribute to tracking 19641⁄2 production data separately from 1965 data (see data below).[25] with production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan, on March 9, 1964;[26] the new car was, on 14 April 1964, first sold to the public,[27][24] before it was even introduced on April 17, 1964,[28] at the New York World's Fair.[29] Body styles available included a two-door hardtop and convertible, with a "2+2" fastback added to the line in September 1964. A Wimbledon White (paint code P)[5] convertible with red interior was used as product placement when the James Bond movie Goldfinger was released September 17, 1964, at its London premiere, where Bond girl Tilly Masterson was in a spirited chase with James driving an Aston Martin DB5 in the Swiss Alps. A Tropical Turquoise (paint code O)[5] coupe was again used in the next film Thunderball at its Tokyo premiere 9 December 1965 with Bond girl Fiona Volpe as she drives James to meet the villain Emilio Largo at his compound at a very high speed across The Bahamas.
        
        Favorable publicity articles appeared in 2,600 newspapers the next morning, the day the car was "officially" revealed.[30][31] A four-seat car with full space for the front bucket seats and a rear bench seat was standard. A "fastback 2+2", first manufactured on August 17, 1964, enclosed the trunk space under a sweeping exterior line similar to the second series Corvette Sting Ray and European sports cars such as the Jaguar E-Type coupe.
        
        Price and record-breaking sales
        
        1967 hardtop
        To achieve an advertised list price of US$2,368 (equivalent to $20,362 in 2021),[17] the Mustang was based heavily on familiar yet simple components, many of which were already in production for other Ford models.[32] Many (if not most) of the interior, chassis, suspension, and drivetrain components were derived from those used on Ford's Falcon and Fairlane. This use of common components also shortened the learning curve for assembly and repair workers, while at the same time allowing dealers to pick up the Mustang without also having to invest in additional spare parts inventory to support the new car line. Original sales forecasts projected less than 100,000 units for the first year.[33] This mark was surpassed in three months from rollout.[5] Another 318,000 would be sold during the model year (a record),[5] and in its first eighteen months, more than one million Mustangs were built.[33]
        
        Upgrades
        Several changes were made at the traditional opening of the new model year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of back-up lights on some models, the introduction of alternators to replace generators, an upgrade of the six-cylinder engine from 170 to 200 cu in (2.8 to 3.3 L) with an increase from 101 to 120 hp (75 to 89 kW), and an upgrade of the V8 engine from 260 to 289 cu in (4.3 to 4.7 L) with an increase from 164 to 210 hp (122 to 157 kW). The rush into production included some unusual quirks, such as the horn ring bearing the 'Ford Falcon' logo covered by a trim ring with a 'Ford Mustang' logo. These characteristics made enough difference to warrant designation of the 121,538 early versions as "1964½" Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists.[34]
        
        
        A 1969 SportsRoof
        Ford's designers began drawing up larger versions even as the original was achieving sales success, and while "Iacocca later complained about the Mustang's growth, he did oversee the 1967 redesign."[35] From 1967 until 1973, the Mustang got bigger but not necessarily more powerful.[36] The Mustang was facelifted, giving the Mustang a more massive look overall and allowing a big block engine to be offered for the first time. Front and rear end styling was more pronounced, and the "twin cove" instrument panel offered a thicker crash pad and larger gauges. Hardtop, fastback, and convertible body styles continued as before. Around this time, the Mustang was paired with a Mercury variant, called the Cougar, which used its own styling cues, such as a "prowling cat" logo and hidden quad headlamps. New safety regulations by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for 1967 included an energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way emergency flashers, and a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system, and softer interior knobs. The 1968 models received revised side scoops, steering wheel, and gasoline caps. Side marker lights were also added that year, and cars built after January 1, 1968, included shoulder belts for both front seats on coupes. The 1968 models also introduced a new 302 cu in (4.9 L) V8 engine, designed with Federal emissions regulations in mind.
        
        The 1969 restyle "added more heft to the body as width and length again increased. Weight went up markedly too."[35] Due to the larger body and revised front end styling, the 1969 models (but less so in 1970) had a notable aggressive stance. The 1969 models featured "quad headlamps" which disappeared to make way for a wider grille and a return to standard headlamps in the 1970 models. This switch back to standard headlamps was an attempt to tame the aggressive styling of the 1969 model, which some felt was too extreme and hurt sales, but 1969 production exceeded the 1970 total.[37]
        
        Models
        Starting in 1969, to aid sales and continue the winning formula of the Mustang, a variety of new performance and decorative options became available, including functional (and non-functional) air scoops, cable and pin hood tie-downs, and both wing and chin spoilers. Additionally, a variety of performance packages were introduced that included the Mach 1, the Boss 302, and Boss 429. The two Boss models were to homologate the engines for racing. The 1969 Mustang was the last year for the GT option (although it did return on the third-generation Mustang for the 1982 model year). A fourth model available only as a hardtop, the Grandé, saw success starting in 1969 with its soft ride, "luxurious" trim, 55 pounds (25 kg) of extra sound deadening, and simulated wood trim.

        Sales fluctuation
        Developed under the watch of S. "Bunkie" Knudsen, Mustang evolved "from speed and power" to the growing consumer demand for bigger and heavier "luxury" type designs.[38] "The result was the styling misadventures of 1971–73 ...the Mustang grew fat and lazy,"[38] "Ford was out of the go-fast business almost entirely by 1971."[39] "This was the last major restyling of the first-generation Mustang."[40] "The cars grew in every dimension except height, and they gained about 800 pounds (360 kg)."[40] "The restyling also sought to create the illusion that the cars were even larger."[40] The 1971 Mustang was nearly 3 inches (75 mm) wider than the 1970, its front and rear track was also widened by 3 inches (75 mm), and its size was most evident in the SportsRoof models with its nearly flat rear roofline[41] and cramped interior with poor visibility for the driver.[42] Performance decreased with sales continuing to decrease[43] as consumers switched to the smaller Pintos and Mavericks. A displeased Iacocca summed up later: "The Mustang market never left us, we left it."[44]</p>
